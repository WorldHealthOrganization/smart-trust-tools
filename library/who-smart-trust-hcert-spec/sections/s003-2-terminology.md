#### 2. Terminology

Organisations adopting this specification for issuing health certificates are called Issuers and organisations accepting health certificates as proof of health status are called Verifiers. Together, these are called Participants. Some aspects in this document must be coordinated between the Participants, such as the management of a namespace and the distribution of cryptographic keys. It is assumed that a party, hereafter referred to as the Secretariat, carries out these tasks. The health certificate container format (HCERT) of this specification is generic, but in this context used to carry the WHO Digital Covid Certificate (DCC).

The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that underpins the trust model consists of a Signing Certificate Authority (SCA) certificate which is used to issue (i.e. sign) the Document Signing Certificate (DSC). The DSC is then used to sign the DCC. The acronyms "PKI", "SCA" and "DSC" are used in the context of the document to refer to the aforementioned concepts.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 ([RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119), [RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174)) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.
