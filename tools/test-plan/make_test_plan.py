"""Write test/plans/hcert-library-conformance.test-plan.json from the graph.

The library conformance plan is the skills and the requirements' success
criteria, laid out as a test-plan/v1: one case per skill, one assertion per
criterion its requirements verify by test, id req:<id>#<statement>/<criterion>.
Written from them so it cannot drift: --check fails when the file is stale.
The test data per case and the plan's prose are set here.

Usage:
    python3 tools/test-plan/make_test_plan.py [--check]

One case per skill; each assertion is a requirement statement's success criterion verified by test (req:<id>#<statement>/<criterion>), so a verdict on an assertion is a verdict on that criterion. Criteria verified by review or inspection are not in this plan: they are judged at release review. A case passes when every required assertion has a passing test named after its requirement in the implementation's suite, run in CI on every target (JVM and Node for Kotlin; native and wasm32 for Rust). The fixed data is the smart-trust PR 129 certificate, the negative vectors derived from it, the GDHCN trust domain code systems and the IHE VHL fixtures; the generated data is the seeded fuzzer's. CI also enforces a coverage floor (STT-TST-010). The WHO-ITB comparison is the separate plan who-itb-agreement, which runs after this one.",
